# WalaAlarm (Walabot Based Fun Alarm Clock)- Say No to Snooze

WalaAlarm is a Walabot based alarm clock with fun modes like "Leave the Room", "Push Ups", "Meditate" and more to wake up on time.

## Story
Do you always wake up late?
Are you in a habit of hitting the snooze button again and again?
Introducing WalaAlarm - Walabot Based Fun Alarm Clock!

The WalaAlarm App contains fun modes like "Leave The Room", "Morning PushUps", "Meditate".

## Inspiration
I always wake up late in the morning, even after setting several alarms I end up hitting snooze button again and again.

I wondered if there was an alarm clock which guarantee that I am awake and is fun to use to, then no one will wake up late in the morning.

I didn't found one so I built one :P

## App
I have made this Android App which let you set alarm on a particular time. The app launches a Pending Intent on set time and activates the Walabot, the server then returns boolean result to the app and the Alarm goes off.
